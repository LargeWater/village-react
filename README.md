# VILLAGE

## A text-based browser game.
Initially built in basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS, now reworking from the ground up in React.

## Much more functionality to come
- Images to represent houses
- more resources like food etc.
- gathering and building will take time
- hunger
- random events (i.e. attacks that kill villagers, destroy houses, eat food, etc.)

## Inspired by [A Dark Room](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/), [Stacklands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948280/Stacklands/) and many other minimal building games.
